# Changelog

## 2026‑10 — Accessible Edition (NARBEHOUSE, LLC)
- Added single‑switch navigation (Space scans forward; hold Space ≥3s scans backward every 2s; Enter selects).
- Aiming via Space (5s oscillation; resumes from release), thicker aiming line; charge‑to‑throw via Enter (0–3s, non‑linear power).
- TTS (English voices only, up to 8): UI focus, settings changes, outcomes ("Strike!"), frame calls, final score.
- Pause menu (hold Enter ≥5s or click Pause) with Continue, Settings, Main Menu; keyboard scanning works there too.
- Two‑Player mode; each player chooses ball style; independent scoring.
- Retro green/black UI; stronger focused highlights; strike celebration overlay.
- Themes (10) with animated walls/backdrops; alley tint changes with theme.
- Environment aligned to lane; back/side walls and scenic backdrop; gutter‑aware floor (center + recessed gutters).
- Pins forced to bright white with minimal lighting tint for readability.
- Audio: ambient loop (`sound/bowling-bg.wav` @ ~30%), rolling (`sound/rolling-ball.wav`), per‑pin (`sound/single-pin.mp3`), music (`music/music (1).mp3`).
- Physics stability: clamped timestep, CCD for ball and pins, increased substeps to reduce tunneling.
