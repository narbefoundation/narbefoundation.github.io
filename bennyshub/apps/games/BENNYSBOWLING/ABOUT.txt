Benny’s Bowling — Accessible Edition

Modified October 2025 by NARBEHOUSE, LLC to support players with severe mobility disabilities (single‑switch controls, TTS, high‑contrast UI). These small games can make a mega difference in someone’s life. We appreciate the work done on the physics engine and other open‑source components.

Key changes:
- One‑switch menus (Space scan forward; hold Space ≥3s scans backward every 2s; Enter select/toggle).
- TTS for UI focus, settings (ball styles and alley themes), outcomes ("Strike!"), frame calls, final score.
- Aiming/throw system with charge power; thicker aiming guide.
- Single‑ and Two‑Player modes; per‑player ball styles and scores.
- Themes with animated walls/backdrops; alley tinting to match themes.
- Gutter‑aware floor and aligned walls/backdrop; pins remain bright white for visibility.
- Audio loop and effects (ambient, rolling, per‑pin) plus optional music.
